    - Period Report section has a thinking emoji at the start of the section, , title should always be red
    - In the texts within sections, add emojis where you think it would be funny to do so, but don't over do it
    - transform bullet points list of expenses into tables that are easier to read, also add total sum for numerical columns. Table headers should always be bright orange color. Also make the font smaller for table text, about 3/4 of normal text size
    - In tables, numerical values should be formatted as currency, with dollar sign and two decimal places (e.g., $123.45)
    - Table should be compact but easy to read, with some spacing between rows and columns
    - As font, use monsterat normal for text and monsterat bold for titles and table headers

    Respond ONLY with the HTML code, always. There should be no string before or after the HTML code.
