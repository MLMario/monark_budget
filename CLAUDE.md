- Lets move on to the second step, use BASELINE_REPORT.md as a guideline to understand the current state of the codebase. When you are done produce a detailed report of what chages have you implemented in this step with clear explanation of pre and post changes, name this file step_2_report.md.

Be sure to run all test in the virtual env at services/api/.venv and check pyproject.toml if you need to validate if there is a dependency install in the virtual env. Any changes in dependencies, install them by modifying the pyproject.toml inside services/api and then running uv lock and uv sync --reinstall --no-cache 

Step 2: Enforce Consistent Style & Remove Low-Risk Redundancy
- Apply formatting (e.g., `black`, `isort`) and update style configuration files to enforce consistency.
- Identify duplicate code blocks and replace them with shared utilities where risk is minimal.
- Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code paths.
- Testing before proceeding:
  - Re-run formatters in check mode to ensure compliance.
  - Execute the baseline automated tests to ensure no functional changes were introduced.
  - Use static analysis (e.g., `flake8`, `pylint`) to verify no new warnings were introduced.
